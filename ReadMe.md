Microservices Implementation with Spring Boot, Eureka Server, Eureka Client, and API Gateway
Spring Boot
Spring Cloud
Java

This Git repository contains a sample project showcasing the implementation of microservices architecture using Spring Boot, Eureka Server, Eureka Client, and API Gateway with Spring Cloud. The project demonstrates how to create a distributed system of microservices and manage service discovery and communication efficiently.


Microservices architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Spring Boot, along with Spring Cloud components such as Eureka Server, Eureka Client, and API Gateway, provides a robust framework for building microservices-based applications. This project serves as a practical example of how to implement these technologies effectively.

Features

Eureka Server: Service discovery and registration server for managing microservices.

Eureka Client: Microservices register themselves with the Eureka Server for automatic discovery.

API Gateway: Acts as an entry point to the microservices, handling routing and load balancing.

Spring Boot: Simplifies the development of production-ready microservices.

Distributed Architecture: Demonstrates how microservices can work together in a distributed environment.
